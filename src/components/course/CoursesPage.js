* the connect function is what we use to create components that

* connect takes two parameters
 * each of these parameters is a function */

/*_Tip:
* the two sets of parentheses looks weird,
* connect call returns a function
* the second set of () is an argument sent to that function
* taking the results of one function and passing it on to another function
* is a common pattern in functional programming */

/*_Tip
 * mapDispatchToProps is for deciding which actions you want to dispatch to your component
 * optional parameter,
  * if you leave it out,
  * our component automatically gets a dispatch property attached to it
  * and this prop is injected by connect,
  * this allows you to use this.props.dispatch in your component.
  * dispatch is a function that allows you to fire off your functions
   *
   * if you add it as a parameter to connect
   * pass dispatch as argument to mapDispatchToProps
   * determines what actions are available in our component
   * wrapping our action creators in a call to dispatch */

  with arrow functions
  you can omit the parentheses when there is a single parameter
  we are declaring an anonymous function here, using the arrow function syntax
  calling dispatch,
  then calling courseActions.createCourse and passing course to it

  this call ends up replacing the overly verbose statement in onClickSave,
  where we uses dispatch up in the component.
  This approach is a little cleaner.
  */
  /*_Tip: By wrapping our actions in a call to dispatch,
  * we trigger our flow through redux
  * Que? Is this what links actions - reducers - store? */

    /*Que? Research arrow functions

    /*_Tip: This is still quite verbose
    * redux comes with a helper function that save us from having to manually wrap
    * our actions in a dispace call, it's call
    * bindActionCreators,

    * instead of doing this:
    // createCourse: course => dispatch(courseActions.createCourse(course))

    you can now do this! */

    /*_Tip: bindActionCreators with go through courseActions,
     find all the actions in that file,
     and then wrap them in a call to dispatch,
      since it's going to be all those actions,
      it makes sense to change the parameter name 'createCourse' to 'actions',
      because now we will be mapping to all of the actions
      that sit in the courseActions file.
      you can now access actions in component with
      this.props.actions */
