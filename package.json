  "//": "alternative for this include gulp and grunt",
  "scripts": {

    "//": "_Tip: by convention npm will run the prestart script before start script",
    "//": "because it's prefixed with the word 'pre",
    "//": "can also add a 'post' start script",
    "//": "Que?: research other options for npm scripts!",
  "prestart": "babel-node tools/startMessage.js",

    "//": "Tip: by convention npm start should start your app",
    "//": "we need to use 'babel-node' to compile because we used ES6 inside",
    "//": "of srcServer",
    "//": "Que?: babel-node? Look up docs. Is it packaged inside of one of the",
    "//": "dependencies below? Where does it come from? Why is is accessible?*/",

    "//": "Tip: 'npm start' now runs multiple scripts at once",
    "//": "--parallel flag, instruction to run anything listed to the right at the same time",
    "//": "now, 'npm start' will do the following:",
    "//": "display start message, because that is in prestart",
    "//": "run webpack",
    "//": "start out dev webserver",

    "//": "alot like refactoring to separate well named functions",

    "//": "_Tip:",
    "//": "eslint lacks watch functionality",
    "//": "Que?: What is watch functionality?",
    "//": "so we are using a handy npm package called eslint watch which has an executable called esw.",
    "//": "watch wraps eslint and provides file watching functionality, it also offers enhanced command line output",
    "//": "telling eslint to watch for webpack.config files",
    "//": "and any files in our src directory or our tools directory",

    "//": "_Tip:",
    "//": "oddly, eslint watch(esw) doesn't watch files by default",
    "//": "you have to pass it a command line flag to tell it you want to enable file watch",
    "//": "creating a separte npm script that will watch our files.",
    "//": "weird syntax, we are jsut running the lint script above",
    "//": "this syntax lets us pass the watch flag to our lint script",
    "//": "so this line is saying, run the eslint script, but pass the watch flag to eslint watch(esw)",
    "//": "Que?: This is a mess! Would be great is this was all contained in the lint script...confusing.",
    "lint:watch": "npm run lint -- --watch",

    "//": "_Tip:",
    "//": "runs mocha",
    "//": " specifies reporter",
    "//": " progress reporter is compact and doesn't add a lot of noise to the terminal",
    "//": " tell mocha to run the testSetup",
    "//": " and to run any tests that it finds in our src directory",
    "//": " following convention of ending all test files in test.js",
